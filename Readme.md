# I try to solve some problems every day...! 😎

## day-01 problems

#### 1. 🛒 “Did I Overpay for That?”

Rahim went to a local bazaar and bought a few items. He now has a list of items with prices stored in a system. Later, his mom asked, “How much did you pay for the carrots?”
You need to help Rahim by writing a program that takes the list of items and searches for the item name his mom asked about, and returns the price.

#### 2. 📚 “Is That Book Available?”

A librarian is building a system where book IDs are always kept sorted. When someone comes and asks if a particular book ID is available, the system should check and reply instantly with a “yes” or “no.”
Help the librarian by writing the logic that efficiently checks if the book is available using the stored sorted list.

#### 3. 🍔 “Arrange Orders by Amount”

A food delivery guy receives multiple orders with different total prices. At the end of the day, he wants to analyze which orders paid him the most, and which the least. But first, he needs to arrange the order amounts in increasing order so it’s easier to see.
Write a program that sorts the order amounts from low to high.

#### 4. 🚌 “When’s the Next Bus to Banani?”

You’re at a digital bus stop where an electronic screen shows all arriving buses and their destinations. You want to build a simple system that finds the first bus that’s going to “Banani” so you can plan your ride. Given a list of buses and destinations, write a program to find the first match for your destination.

#### 5. 🏆 “Who’s Winning the Tournament?”

You’re in charge of a school coding tournament scoreboard. Every player’s score is being tracked. Your task is to display the leaderboard from the highest score to the lowest so everyone can see who’s leading. Use logic to rearrange the players based on their scores.
