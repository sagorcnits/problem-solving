## day-01 problems

#### 1. 🛒 “Did I Overpay for That?”

Rahim went to a local bazaar and bought a few items. He now has a list of items with prices stored in a system. Later, his mom asked, “How much did you pay for the carrots?”
You need to help Rahim by writing a program that takes the list of items and searches for the item name his mom asked about, and returns the price.

#### 2. 📚 “Is That Book Available?”

A librarian is building a system where book IDs are always kept sorted. When someone comes and asks if a particular book ID is available, the system should check and reply instantly with a “yes” or “no.”
Help the librarian by writing the logic that efficiently checks if the book is available using the stored sorted list.
